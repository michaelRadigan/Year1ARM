\section{Group Organisation}

Our organisation was not ideal from the start. In my opinion I believe that this is because all our our group members were at different stages of learning C. We had decided to try and get the emulator finished as soon as possible. This led to a lot of work being done in the first day or two by the group member who was already familiar with C. When the rest of the group were comfortable with the language it was a real struggle to both catch up and also contribute effectively. There was a fair bit of confusion (possible exacerbated by a lack of familiarity with with git) leading ultimately to quite a bit of redundant code being written, and of course deleted. This led to much of the emulator being written by one person.

We believe that in part 2 we will be able to learn form our mistakes and manage our time more efficiently (not just because all of our group now know the language). 



\section{Implementation Strategies}
\subsection{Emulator}
We have based the program design has been structured on the design of a physical CPU, thus the steps involved are as so:
\begin{enumerate}
\item



\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assembler}
