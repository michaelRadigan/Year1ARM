\section{Group Organisation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Henryk started first as he had already learnt c

\item
when others in the group got to helping a day later,they did not understand the method completely

\item 
led to a lot of confusion, and lots of redundant code being written (and deleted)

\item
in the end Henryk wrote most of the code for emulater


\item
Mickey was put in charge of writing tests for the code and tryied to introduce TDD for emulater , but ultimately failed due to time constraints. 

\item
Due to the confusion during our handling of part 1, we took a much more organised approach to the creation of the assembler. We feel that our time management and productivity will have improved as a result.

We have based the program design has been structured on the design of a physical CPU, thus the steps involved are as so:
